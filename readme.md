This is my project for my ReactJS course. This app was made using React.

It features an authentication service. Logged-In users are able to add cars. The owners of the cars are able to edit and delete them. Non-owners are able to upvote cars. You can also search for cars by make or model.

## Installation
After downloading the repository, navigate to the client folder and type **npm install**.
